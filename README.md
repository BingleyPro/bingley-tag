## Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this map, here are the rules:
- You can submit a pull request if you would like to fix/add something part of the **datapack**.
- If you would like to add your own map, make a schematic (or multiple schematics). Create a folder with your map's name in the **info/maps/** folder, and add the schematics labelled with your map's name + schematic number _(for example, **bingley-meadow001.schematic**, **bingley-meadow002.schematic** etc)_. Also include a .txt file with your map's name with information about how the schematics line up, as well as map size and any special events that happen on the map. If your map is accepted, it will be added in the one of the next versions of the world, and you will be credited on the Maps and Credit sections on the readme.md and on the wiki (as well as in-game). **By contributing your map, you agree that small changes may be made to your map without your permission.** If you don't agree with that condition, mention that in your pull request, however your map will have a higher chance of being rejected. If it gets rejected, the reason should be provided to you, and you can resubmit it as many times as you want. Also, you give us the right to use your map in the world for free. If you don't agree with this rule, then please don't submit a map.
- Never edit any of the world files. Any pull requests with this will be rejected. For errors in the map, use the **Issues** tab to report it.
- This world is still in active development and it still a prototype, so more contributing rules will be added later.
